# Jetsnack sample

Jetsnack is a sample snack ordering app built with [Jetpack Compose][compose].

To try out this sample app, you need to use 
[Android Studio Arctic Fox](https://developer.android.com/studio).
You can clone this repository or import the
project from Android Studio following the steps
[here](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/setup#sample).

This sample showcases:

* How to implement a custom design system
* Custom layout
* Animation

### Status: ðŸš§ In progress ðŸš§

Jetsnack is still under development and some screens are not yet implemented.

## Features

### Custom Design System

Jetsnack's major feature is demonstrating how to implement a custom design system. Jetsnack has a bespoke color system and does not use [Material color theming](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html).

This is implemented by:

* [`JetsnackColorPalette`](app/src/main/java/com/example/jetsnack/ui/theme/Theme.kt#L114) a class modelling the desired color system.
* [`JetsnackColorAmbient`](app/src/main/java/com/example/jetsnack/ui/theme/Theme.kt#L231) an [ambient](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/Ambient) holding the current color set.
* [`ProvideJetsnackColors`](app/src/main/java/com/example/jetsnack/ui/theme/Theme.kt#L222) a composable function [providing](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/package-summary#Providers(androidx.compose.ProvidedValue,%20kotlin.Function0)) a `JetsnackColorPalette`
* [`JetsnackTheme` object](app/src/main/java/com/example/jetsnack/ui/theme/Theme.kt#L104), providing convenient access to the current theme colors.
* [`JetsnackTheme` composable](app/src/main/java/com/example/jetsnack/ui/theme/Theme.kt#L81), the app's theme. Note that while Jetsnack implements a custom color system, it still uses Material's shape and type theming.

Jetsnack wraps Material components, customizing them to use its color system. See the [components package](app/src/main/java/com/example/jetsnack/ui/components) e.g. [`JetsnackButton`](app/src/main/java/com/example/jetsnack/ui/components/Button.kt). Jetsnack makes heavy use of gradients, see [`Gradient`](app/src/main/java/com/example/jetsnack/ui/components/Gradient.kt) for a number of helpful [`Modifier`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/Modifier)s.

### Custom Layout

Jetsnack utilizes custom [`Layout`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/package-summary#layout_1)s to achieve its design. See:

* [`CollapsingImageLayout`](app/src/main/java/com/example/jetsnack/ui/snackdetail/SnackDetail.kt#L274) shown above.
* [`SearchCategory`](app/src/main/java/com/example/jetsnack/ui/home/search/Categories.kt#L97) custom positioning of an image and text items.
* [`JetsnackBottomNavLayout`](app/src/main/java/com/example/jetsnack/ui/home/Home.kt#L170) a custom Bottom Navigation implementation which animates the width of selected/unselected items.
