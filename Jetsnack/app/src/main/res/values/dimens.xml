    2x2 as minimum resize size and 4x4 as maximum resize size). For image heavy
    widgets like this, a 4x2 drop size allows the default view that user will see
    to include the images. And if user wishes to use it as a utility compact
    widget, a 2x2 resize would be possible where only list text is displayed.
