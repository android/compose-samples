## Features

- Animation Gallery: A centralized list showcasing a wide variety of Jetpack Compose animation effects.
- Interactive Demos: Users can directly interact with animation samples to intuitively experience how they work.
- Categorized Browsing: Animations are organized by type and complexity for easy discovery and learning.
- Detail Views: Each animation has a dedicated detail page with more in-depth demonstrations and explanations.
- Modern UI Design: Built entirely with Jetpack Compose, following Material Design principles for a sleek and smooth interface.
- Code References: Provides core implementation code snippets for each animation, enabling developers to learn and apply them quickly.
- 100% Kotlin: The entire project is written in Kotlin.

## Future planning

- [x] Basic Feature Available

- [x] Add sharedTransition API for list view
- [x] Add more annotations for the project
- [x] Use CI/CD for best practice
- [ ] Upload the application to F-Droid
- [ ] Upload the application to GooglePlay

## Why I Made Animora?

Because I fell in love with Material Design long before I became an Android developer.

When I was still a student, Google’s **Material You** design language deeply resonated with me.  
I had always hoped that one day, I could build a **Material Design app of my own** — not as a demo, not as a concept, but as a real, usable product.

Animora is the result of that long-standing aspiration.

---

Because I believe technology should be equal and transparent.

My first online name was **Free-Terder**, literally meaning *“Free Trader”*.  
It was built upon a single belief that has stayed with me for many years:

> **Truth will eventually pierce lies, and technology should belong to everyone.**

This belief accompanied me from Android ROM flashing, through Linux fundamentals, and finally to software development itself.  
In 2024, I made a firm decision to become an **Android Developer**, and Animora is a concrete step forward on that path.

---

Because learning Android should not feel hopeless.

While learning **Kotlin**, **Android development**, and **Jetpack Compose**,  
this belief repeatedly pulled me back from frustration and self-doubt.

Animora was created during those moments —  
as something I wished had existed when I was learning animations, state, and interaction in Compose.

---

Because doing the right thing is harder than doing the reasonable thing.

While preparing Animora for release, I was reading *Silo*, which left a strong impression on me:

> **Doing the right thing is not the same as doing the reasonable thing.  
> And between the two, the reasonable choice is always easier.**

Still, I believe the light of human civilization is real.  
There are always people willing to carry the weight and choose what is right —  
and I choose to stand among them.

---

Because I chose open source, deliberately.

I did not choose the common path of **closed source + paid access**.  
That is simply not the future I want to see.

Closed information barriers breed ignorance.  
Animora exists — and is fully open source — precisely because I want to resist that outcome.

---

Because I want Animora to help more people.

- To help struggling developers **feel less alone**, and have something reliable to lean on
- To help students learning *Java for Android* **realize early that academic knowledge is often outdated or incomplete**
- To contribute, even in a small way, to a **healthier and more honest open-source ecosystem**
- To find like-minded people and **build things together**

---

In a word, Animora tries to do the right thing —  
with clean code, modern Android practices, and an honest intent.
